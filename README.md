# Empty Echoes

## Project Description
Empty Echoes is a humbly ambitious work-in-progress project that combines 3D science fiction and zero-gravity horror. Developed in Unity using C# scripting, this project showcases meticulously crafted 3D designs in Blender.

Through iterative development and the integration of EEG brain-scanning technology and heart monitors, provided by Northeastern University, Empty Echoes aims to create an immersive experience that captures players' physiological responses, pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling.

This collaborative project represents technical expertise and a dedicated commitment to redefine immersive gaming experiences. Please note that this project is still a work in progress.

## Features
- **3D Science Fiction & Zero-Gravity Horror:** A deeply immersive sci-fi setting combined with zero-gravity mechanics to enhance the horror experience.
- **Unity & C# Development:** Built using Unity's powerful game engine and custom C# scripting.
